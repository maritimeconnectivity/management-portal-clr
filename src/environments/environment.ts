Please use generic names, such as \'John Doe\' and generic email addresses such as \'info@company.com\'. It does need to be a working email address though, since access will be granted through this email address. Furthermore, if anyone chooses to federate an identity registry into the MCP testbed, this should only contain test data - not actual personal information. This is due to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For more information, contact the MCC secretariat.',
